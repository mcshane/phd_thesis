\noindent Firstly, I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisor, A/Prof. Sergei Kuzenko and co-supervisor, A/Prof. Ian McArthur for their guidance and support. I am especially grateful to Sergei, without whose enthusiasm, direction and encouragement, I would have been at a loss.

I would like to acknowledge funding from a UWA Hackett Postgraduate Scholarship, and later from a UWA Completion Scholarship. In addition, a visit to the Center for String and Particle Theory at the University of Maryland was partially funded by a UWA Graduates Association Postgraduate Research Travel Award. Thank you to Prof. Jim Gates for hospitality and support during my stay, and also to everyone there who made it an enjoyable visit.

Thank you to all my friends for their help and support. To all the college kids for keeping me company through my various film and television obsessions, and keeping me sane with the various high table shenanigans. To the uni crew, for all the lunches on the lawn, various sporting activities, quiz nights, etc\dots

Finally, a big thank you to my family, who may not understand what it is that I've been doing, but have been supportive of the fact that I'm doing what I want to do.
